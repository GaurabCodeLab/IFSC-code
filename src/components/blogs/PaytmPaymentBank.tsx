            <p>
              In response to the question "is Paytm Payments Bank working?" -
              Paytm Payments Bank continues to operate but with significant
              limitations. Existing customers can withdraw their funds, but
              cannot deposit new money or receive incoming transfers. New
              customers cannot open accounts at this time. These restrictions
              were imposed by the RBI due to concerns about compliance and
              operational issues.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The RBI's regulatory action was taken after supervisory concerns
            were noted, including issues related to KYC processes, transaction
            monitoring, and IT infrastructure. These restrictions are intended
            to protect customer interests while addressing compliance concerns.

                  The IFSC code for Paytm Payment Bank is{" "}
                  <strong>PYTM0123456</strong>. This is a universal IFSC code
                  used for all Paytm Payment Bank accounts across India. You can
                  use this code for receiving money from any bank through NEFT,
                  RTGS, or IMPS transactions. Unlike traditional banks that have

                  Bank uses this single IFSC code nationwide, making it easier
                  to remember and use. When providing your bank details for

                  Bank account number and this IFSC code.

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>
                  As per RBI guidelines for payment banks, Paytm Payment Bank
                  has a maximum balance limit of â‚¹2 lakhs per customer. If your
                  account balance exceeds this limit, the excess amount may need
                  to be transferred to another bank account. This limit applies
                  to the end-of-day balance, and there are no restrictions on
                  the number of transactions or the total amount that can flow
                  through the account during the day. For wallet users with
                  minimal KYC, the limit is typically lower at â‚¹10,000, while
                  fully KYC-verified wallet users can maintain up to â‚¹1 lakh.

            Paytm Payment Bank is currently operating under significant

            importance of compliance in the banking sector.
